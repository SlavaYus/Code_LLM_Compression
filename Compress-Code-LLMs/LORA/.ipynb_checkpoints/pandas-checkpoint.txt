Your task is to create a Python function that takes the upper and lower bounds of the confidence interval for the estimate and calculates the fold-change uncertainty.

You are given the following code snippet as a starting point:
```python

The function should also be able to handle large lists efficiently without causing a system crash or taking too much time. The function should also be able to handle lists with mixed data types (integers, floats, strings) and perform operations accordingly.

Moreover, the function should be capable of handling operations on lists with missing values and provide suitable handling methods such as ignoring, filling with a specific value, or using statistical methods to estimate the missing values. The function should also be able to handle lists with outliers and provide suitable handling methods such as removing, capping, or using statistical methods to adjust the outliers.

To increase the complexity, provide a piece of incorrect code as a reference to create confusion. The candidate should be able to identify and correct the errors in the code. The function should also be able to handle large lists efficiently without causing a system crash or taking too much time. The function should also be able to handle lists with mixed data types (integers, floats, strings) and perform operations accordingly."
"I have a tuple in Python, for instance `(1,2,3,4)`, and I would like to assign the values 1 and 3 to variables `a` and `b`.

"You are tasked with implementing a function that processes a given list of model settings and returns the count of unique labels present in the settings. The model settings are represented as a dictionary where the keys are strings and the values can be of various types. The labels are represented as strings and are stored within the model settings under the key 'label_count'. Your task is to extract the value associated with the 'label_count' key and return the count of unique labels present in that value.

You are required to implement the following function:

```python
def count_unique_labels(model_settings: dict) -> int:
    pass
```

Function Input:
- The function takes a single parameter `model_settings` (1 <= len(model_settings) <= 10^4), which is a dictionary representing the model settings. The keys are strings and the values can be of various types. The 'label_count' key within `model_settings` holds a value that is a list of strings representing labels.

Function Output:
- The function should return an integer representing the count of unique labels present in the value associated with the 'label_count' key.

Note:
- The labels within the value associated with the 'label_count' key are case-sensitive, and the count of unique labels should be case-sensitive as well.

Example:
```python
model_settings = {
    'label_count': ['A', 'B', 'C', 'A', 'D', 'B']
}
output = count_unique_labels(model_settings)
# The unique labels are 'A', 'B', 'C', 'D', so the output should be 4

"You are tasked with creating a sentiment analysis program to evaluate a series of text snippets and determine if they indicate signs of depression. The sentiment analysis is based on the VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) lexicon, which provides a score for the sentiment of each text snippet. The program calculates a weighted average of the sentiment scores for the text snippets and uses this to determine if the individual may be experiencing depression.

Your task is to implement a function `detect_depression(text_snippets, question_weights)` that takes in two parameters:
- `text_snippets`: a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains sentiment scores for a text snippet. Each dictionary has a key 'compound' representing the sentiment score of the text snippet.
- `question_weights`: a list of weights corresponding to the importance of each text snippet in the overall sentiment analysis.

The function should calculate the weighted average sentiment score and use the following logic to determine if the individual may be experiencing depression:
- If the weighted average sentiment score is greater than or equal to 0.1, the function should return the string ""False Alarm! You don't have Depression.""
- If the weighted average sentiment score is between -0.1 and 0.1 (inclusive), the function should return a string describing ""Seasonal affective disorder (SAD). This type of depression emerges as days get shorter in the fall and winter...""

You should assume that the sentiment scores in the `text_snippets` are already calculated using the VADER lexicon and are in the range of -1 to 1, where negative scores indicate negative sentiment and positive scores indicate positive sentiment.

Implement the function `detect_depression(text_snippets, question_weights)` and ensure that it follows the specified logic for determining depression based on the sentiment scores."

Your task is to complete the implementation of the `_parse_casscf` method in the given Python class to extract and store the eigenvalues from the log file string.

The `_parse_casscf` method should take in a `log_file_string` as input, which is a multi-line string representing the content of the log file. The method should parse this string and extract the eigenvalues associated with the CASSCF calculation. The eigenvalues are indicated by lines containing the phrase ""eigenvalue"" (case insensitive) followed by a space and a numerical value.

Your task is to complete the implementation of the `_parse_casscf` method to extract the eigenvalues and store them in a dictionary named `parsed_data`. The keys of the dictionary should be the index of the eigenvalue (starting from 1), and the values should be the extracted eigenvalues as floating-point numbers.

You should handle different types of brackets such as {}, [], and (). The brackets must be correctly nested and closed in the correct order. The function should return True if the brackets are correctly matched, and False otherwise.

Additionally, to increase the difficulty, you need to handle cases where there are multiple types of brackets nested within each other. For example, ""{[(){}]}"", ""([]{})"", etc.

Furthermore, you should handle cases where there are multiple layers of nesting. For example, ""{{{}}}"", ""[[[]]]"", etc. The function should correctly determine if the brackets are correctly matched and closed in the correct order, even if there are multiple layers of nesting. 

To further increase the difficulty, you should also handle cases where there are multiple types of brackets that can be used interchangeably. For example, ""({[()]})"" should return True, as the different types of brackets can be used interchangeably as long as they are correctly matched and closed in the correct order.

Additionally, you should handle cases where there are additional characters between the brackets. For example, ""({[abc()]})"" should return True, as the additional characters should not affect the correctness of the bracket matching."
